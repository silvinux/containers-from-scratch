= Containers From Scratch

I will try to explain through simple examples how *linux namespaces* technology is used to create that thing we call *containers*. But what a *container* is?, there are many info in blogs, articles over internet generally speaking about containers, according to that we can said that a *container* is isolated process running on a host. Container runtimes takes advantage over some pretty cool Linux kernel technologies that you might have overheard as namespaces, cgroups, chroots, etc. plus security layers like SELinux or Seccomp.

Container runtime have different approaches, in Docker tehy'll get their own namespace, meanwhile in CoreOSâ€™ rkt, will be grouped and containers will share namespaces, each of which is called a pod.

We will see how we can leverage these technologies on Linux in order to build and run our own containers, and then we will contrast it against kubernetes / openshift

== Container Tools 

To be able to get the job done, we will need access to machine with basics container tools, like the following:

* Buildah builds
* Podman runs
* Skopeo transfers container images.
* Container-selinux
* Containernetworking-plugins
* Fuse-overlayfs
* slirp4netns


I will be using a RHEL8/Fedora server. The tools I've mentioned before could be installed through package modules, which will make our life easier.  

```bash
$ sudo dnf module install container-tools -y
$ sudo dnf install -y jq tree
$ pip3 install yq --user
```
